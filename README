basecamp_notify
===============

A super-simple Capistrano recipe that hooks into your deploy process and
posts new messages to your project's Basecamp account on each deploy,
containing the abbreviated commit logs of each commit between the last deploy
and the current deploy.

INSTALLATION:

* Stick it in yourapp/vendor/plugins/basecamp_notify
* Copy the example configuration containing your sensible Basecamp login data
  from examples/basecamp.yml into config/basecamp.yml and adjust the contents.
  (And ignore it via .gitignore)

KNOWN ISSUES:

* Only works with git. But this is GitHub after all.
* You might have to fork to customize the look-and-feel of the posted messages
* No error checking, really
